    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Christoph Riedl is the Joseph G. Riesman Research assistant professor for Information Systems at the D’Amore-McKim School of Business at Northeastern University. He hold a joint appointment with the College of Computer &amp; Information Science and is a core faculty at the Network Science Institute. He is a fellow at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS) at Harvard University. He is recipient of a Young Investigator Award (YIP) from Army Research Office (ARO) for his work on social networks in collaborative decision-making. Before joining Northeastern University he was a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard Business School and IQSS. He received a PhD in Information Systems from Technische Universität München (TUM), Germany in 2011, a MSc in Information Systems in 2007, and a BSc in Computer Science in 2006. His work has been funded by NSF and published in leading journals including Management Science, Information Systems Research, and Academy of Management Discoveries.</p>

<p>His research interests are in business analytics, data science, and computational social science which he applies to substantive research questions on group-decision making, network science, and social media. He applies and develops novel computational approaches and machine learning to analyze (experimental) field data in order to study the design of contests, crowd sourcing, and collective intelligence mechanisms. For example, he investigates various aspects of team formation and team work in competitions for creative workers.</p>

<p>Christoph Riedl teaches courses on Business Analytics, Applied Machine Learning, and Information Systems at D’Amore-McKim School of Business and the College of Computer &amp; Information Science at Northeastern University. He is also actively involved in the Network Science PhD Program.</p>
